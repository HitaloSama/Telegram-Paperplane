## What is

Paperplane Minimal is a minimalist fork of the Paperplane userbot, no database and only with modules that I (Hitalo) find useful and necessary for my use of Telegram.

## Getting started

Getting started is pretty easy, but a few commands currently rely on API access through a few different services, so be ready to sign up for some free accounts.

Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/HitaloSama/PaperplaneMinimal.git` and enter the newly created `PaperplaneMinimal` directory. Go ahead and open the directory.

Now install the requirements with

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the required dependencies. After this, you need to copy and expand the sample configuration file. Create a new file named `config.py` and make sure in the header you have `from sample_config import Config`. After that just copy the contents of the Config class in the `sample_config.py` file to your new file, fill in with your data and you should be done. You need your user API key and hash, you can get those in the [Telegram Core API](https://my.telegram.org/) website.

With these done, you should be ready to run your bot, follow the instructions in Starting up section. Good luck.
